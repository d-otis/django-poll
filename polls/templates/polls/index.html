    The problem with this hardcoded, tightly-coupled approach is that it 
    becomes challenging to change URLs on projects with a lot of templates. 
    However, since you defined the name argument in the path() functions in 
    the polls.urls module, you can remove a reliance on specific URL paths 
    defined in your url configurations by using the {% url %} template tag:

    Here with 'url' we're saying: look @ the urls.py paths and find the one
    we named 'detail'; take that url scheme and replace <int:question_id> 
    with the question.id of the question element
    {% endcomment %}
      <a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% else %}
  <p>No polls available</p>
{% endif %}
